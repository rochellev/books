## Project Set Up
This section shows how the Book App source code is set up. So you can follow along. I assume you have completed other React tutorials, i will briefly show the method I chose for this project-- Create React App.

Cleaning up the Create React app



## Steps for setting up
TK
- assume reader has made react apps in the past
- assume reader knows how to set up repo. 
- link to relevant resources for the parts not included in this tutorial
- refer to create react app doc
- show reader how the tutorial project is set up-- directory, file names 


1. Follow steps for [create-react-app](TK)
2. In terminal in the root directory, run the command `yarn start`. This will prove your app was once working.
